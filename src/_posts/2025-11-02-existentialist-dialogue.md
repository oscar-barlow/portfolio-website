title: "The self-referential argument"

_Two friends who hadn't seen each other for a while met by chance on a cold winter's day, traversing the park. Neither had anywhere pressing to be. They each bought a coffee from the kiosk, walked a while and sat on a bench while they talked._

**Nemo:** Now Bert, you must allow me to set you straight on the whole question of free. I can't believe you still cling to it? I'm sorry to say old friend, I know it's convenient for all sorts of things - individualism and morality and so on - but it isn't real and we must face it.

**Albert:** I do cling to it. Well, let's hear it?

**Nemo** I don't remotely see how you can claim to believe in both cause and effect, and in free will. It's one or the other. We met in the park, because you and I were both walking here, and you were walking here because of... all the way back to the first cause, whatever that may be! Or believe somehow that humans have a special ability to break these kinds of causal chains. Suppose I tried to order a cuckoo instead of a coffee at the kiosk - that kind of thing. It would have to be that kind of thing because anything remotely sensible would have an attributable cause, which would make it un-free. But this kind of free will just means a load of randomness, so it's not really free either. As I see it, that forces you back to chains upon chains of cause and effect, with no room for free will. 

lay it out, cause and effect. one thing leads to another.
Newtonian physics is bunk though

the whole of psychology and sociology though. the way you dress and speak, where you choose to go on holday etc - all these are products of your culture and upbringing.
people of similar background they're not identical
of course not, we can speak in terms of probabilities though. your behaviour ultimatley only expresses a probability function.
this is a story pundits tell after an election - whatever the result was, it was inevitable as a result of this and that background factor. The kind of inevitable that is only evident after the fact.
proving the background thing is unfalsifiable.
but look let's talk about this very conversation. suppose you convince me, or i convince you. It's totally intractable to claim either of us being convinced is a result of our psychology or sociology. How could you possibly prove that? What's the counterfactual? Is it really so hard to believe that what appears to be happening is happening - To convince is to acknowledge the mental as causal. The mind has a determinative power. Your experience of your own life is as if you have agency, you act that way, you do have it!

Every conversation about freedom contains its own proof. 

So you deny background etc have anything to do with it? We're back to cause and effect!
No, there's clearly something there, but that's clearly not the end of it
Conditioned freedom. This is why we need de Beauvoir.

We do not have agency all the time. We must fight for it.
