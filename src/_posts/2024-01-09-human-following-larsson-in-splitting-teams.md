The chapter right after the introduction of [Larson, W. (2019). _An Elegant Puzzle: Systems of Engineering Management._ Stripe Press](https://lethain.com/elegant-puzzle/)[^1] concerns itself with sizing engineering teams. There's a lot in this chapter -- these points are salient for the moment:
* Managers should manage between 6 and 8 engineers
* A team with less than 4 members is not a true team
* Don't create empty teams

These are what Larson calls 'steady state' principles, which can be violated during transitional periods[^2]. The first bullet provides a useful constant to orient one's thinking around structuring teams. Relating to this, Larson provides this advice:

> To create a new team, grow an existing team to eight to ten, and then bud into two teams of four or five 

This is a method for splitting teams, but the reason for doing so needs to be drawn out a bit more. Namely, and with reference back to the 'constant' described above, _a team should be split up when its scope exceeds what can be done by 6 to 8 engineers_.

This sounds like it's just common sense. Many engineering managers have done similar based on intuition, or observing symptoms that suggest a team has responsibility that exceeds its capacity[^3]. Nonetheless there's value in plainly stating the principle, and remembering where it derives from. In this case, it derives from a human-centric 'constant'. 

[^1]: A book which has a great deal to recommend it. Every chapter is full of practical advice born of experience.
[^2]: In case the meaning is not clear, if e.g. 2 members of a 6-person team depart, it doesn't mean the team becomes a non-team and should be disbanded. It means the team should be brought back to strength.
[^3]: Missed deadlines, overlong planning sessions, lack of purpose, no-one fully understands the architecture... other symptoms are easy to imagine.
