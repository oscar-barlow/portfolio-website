My friend Miles told me something about artists a while ago. Namely, that the ones who produce good[^1] art tend to be less prejudiced, because inherent to their work is the ability to see from another person's perspective.

This isn't a rule, it's too easy to find empathy and prejudice in the same person. An example might be Charles Dickens, whose novel [_Oliver Twist_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oliver_Twist) is deeply sympathetic to the poor and destitute; and contains perhaps the most famous antisemitic caricature in English literature.

So let's call it a heuristic. It was what I had in mind when I listend to the [_Conversations with Tyler_ episode with Seamus Murphy](https://conversationswithtyler.com/episodes/seamus-murphy/). In general, Tyler Cowan asks the same question over and over again[^2]: 'explain this thing to me, according to your judgement.' Murphy never answers the question straight. It seems to me that he barely understands it - that forming such judgements isn't really part of his psychology. Because, to judge would prevent him from seeing. It would stop him from making his art.

So I think Miles was right. Always good to get a little empirical support for one's heuristics!
